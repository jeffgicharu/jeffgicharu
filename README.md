# Jeff Gicharu

Software developer who picks the right tool for the problem, not the other way around.

Most developers master one stack. I take a different approach—I understand systems, make architectural decisions, and let AI handle the syntax. The result: I ship production code in whatever language the problem demands.

## Recently Worked With

Django · Rust · Next.js · Prisma · PostgreSQL · Node.js · React · Tailwind · Linux · Nginx · Docker

But I'm not limited to these.
